3.0 - Compile execute and test code in this chapter (see ex01.cpp).

3.1 - Prove that all values must be kept to calculate the median when the total
is unknown.
A: Proof by contradiction.  In any set of N elements, sampling k of them results
in N - k remaining. If a k is discarded and N can be arbitrarily large, it is
possible to obtain another k - 1 elements such that k is precisely in between
all elements, which requires it to be kept.

3.2 Write a program to compute the quartiles of a set of integers (see ex02.cpp).
This actually was supposed to be just "print set of integers by quarters, but I
decided to do quartiles instead.  Oh well.

3.3 Write a program to count the number of times each distinct word appears in
its input (see ex03.cpp).

3.4 Write a program to print the longest and shortest length of strings in input
(see ex04.cpp).

3.5 Write program to keep track of multiple student's grades, with one vec
holding names and another final grades (see ex05.cpp).

3.6 Write program so that it handles case of 0 hw assignments and report what
divide by zero does (see ex06.cpp - which uses median pgm but with avg instead.

A: Divide-by-zero results in nan result.
