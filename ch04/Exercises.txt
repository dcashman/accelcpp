4.0 - Skipping because it just takes too much time!

4.1 - Argument types to max must match exactly.  Will the following code work,
and if not, how would you fix it?

"""
int maxlen;
Student_info s;
max(s.name.size(), maxlen);

"""

Types must be the same size, so cast one to the other.  In this case, csat int
to std::string::size_type.

4.2 - Write number and its square in two columns for numbers 0 - 99.
A: See ex01.cpp

4.3 - What happens if numbers go up to 1000?
A: My first attempt actually didn't have an issue with this since I chose 10
for the first setw() call.  Replacing this with the value 3 resulted in the
columns colliding.  We can fix this by calculating the length of the largest
number and then make sure setw() has at least that many values.

4.4 - Change program to use doubles instead of ints.
A: See ex03.cpp

4.5 - Write a function that reads words from an input stream and stores them in
a vector.  Use said function to write programs wich count the number of words in
the input and how many times each occured.  See ex04.cpp

4.6 - Skipping because it requires rewriting code snippets skipped in 4.0.

4.7 - Write a program to calculate the average of numbers stored in a double.
See ex05.cpp

4.8 - If the following code is legal, what can we infer about the return value
of f?
double d = f()[n];

A: returns a double.
