Doing every third exercise because time is tight and 15 is waaay too many.

12.1 - Reimplement the Str class, but choose an implementation strategy that
requires that the class manage the storage itself, e.g. array of chars + length.
See ex01.cpp

12.4 - Define the equality and inequality operators for Str.  See ex01.cpp

12.7 - The standard string class provides random-access iterators to manipulate
the characters.  Add begin() and end() to the class.  Already done as part of
12.1 (see Str.h).

12.10 - Add a constuctor to Vec that takes two iterators.

A: Just means adding the following line:
template <class T> Vec<T>::Vec(iterator b, iterator e) { create(b, e); }

12.15 - Provide an assign function which could assign values from an array
into a vec.

A: pointers are iterators, so just use the previously defined constructor,
since we don't need to keep around old state:

uncreate();
create(arr, arr + arr_len);
