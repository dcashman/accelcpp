2.0 - Compile execute and test code in this chapter (see ex01.cpp).

2.1 - Change program to remove separation in frame (see ex02.cpp).

2.2 - Change program to use different padding on top 'n' bottom from sides.
(see ex03.cpp).

2.3 - Change program so that user may specify horizontal and vertical spacing
(see ex04.cpp).

2.4 - Change program so that the spaced between the borders and the greeting are
written in chunks, rather than one character at a time (see ex05.cpp).

2.5 - Write a set of '*' characters so that they create a rectangle, square and
triangle (see ex06.cpp).

2.6 - What does the code snippet do?
A: prints out 0123456789

2.7 - Write a program to count down from 10 to -5 (see ex07.cpp).

2.8 - Write a program to calculate the product of numbers [1, 10) (see ex08.cpp)

2.9 - Write a program which asks users to enter two numbers and says which is
larger (see ex09.cpp)

2.10 - Explain each of the uses of 'std' in the given snippet.
A: The first one indicates that the 'std' namespace will be used, which
means it will be searched for name resolution: meaning that 'std::' will not
need to be prefixed to std library component calls.  The second two, however
happen after the 'using' statement went out of scope, so its magic has worn off.
