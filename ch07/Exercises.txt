7.1 - Change program on p124 to sort output based on word count.
A: Use another associative container for each count. See ex01.cpp

7.2 - Extend the program on p64 to output how many students get each grade from
A - F. A: 90-100, B: 80- 89.99, etc.  See ex02.cpp

7.3 - Change the cross-reference program on p126 so that line numbers are not
reported multiple times for a given word.  See ex03.cpp

7.4 - The output of the cross-reference program will be ungainly if the input
file is large.  Rewrite it to break up the output in this case.  I'm taking this
to  mean don't have really long lines w/out carriage return. See ex04.cpp

7.5 - Reimplement the grammar program using a list as the data structure in which
the sentence is built.  See ex05.cpp

7.6 - Reimplement gen_sentence without recursion, but instead using two vectors:
one to hold the unwound\, generated sentence, and the other to hold the rules as
a stack.  See ex06.cpp

7.7 - Change the driver for the cross-reference program so that it writes line
if there is only one line and lines otherwise.  See ex07.cpp

7.8 - Change the cross-reference program to find all the URLs in a file, and
write all the lines on which each distinct URL occurs.  See ex08.cpp

7.9 - (difficult) The implementation of nrand will not work for arguments
greater than RAND_MAX.  Reimplement so that it works well for all values of n.
See ex09.cpp - but would use RAND_MAX instead of rmax.
